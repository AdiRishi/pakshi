# Pakshi

A TypeScript monorepo for Cloudflare applications with multiple web apps, Workers, and shared resources. Alchemy owns the infrastructure graph and bindings; Effect services implement application behavior.

The included CSV profiler connects a TanStack Start web app, an API Worker, and a background processor through D1, R2, Queues, and a Durable Object.

## Start a project

Use Node.js 24 and Corepack:

```sh
npx degit AdiRishi/application-platform-starter acme-platform
cd acme-platform
corepack enable
pnpm install
pnpm rename acme-platform
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Run `rename` once on a fresh copy. Open the URL printed by Alchemy and upload `fixtures/transactions.csv` to exercise the platform.

When you start your own application, follow [Remove the sample application](docs/getting-started.mdx#remove-the-sample-application).

The sample is anonymous and shared: every visitor can list and download uploaded files. Replace it before handling private data.

## Read the docs

The documentation is a [Blume](https://useblume.dev/) site. From the repository root:

```sh
pnpm docs:dev
```

Open the local URL printed by Blume. The docs server runs independently of the application and needs no Cloudflare credentials.
